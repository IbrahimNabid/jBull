# jBull (WeBull Clone)
### jBull is an <strong>Agile-driven Java team project</strong> (in progress) that utilizes the Swing API to create a GUI-based hypothetical investment application, using real-time data from an external API.

<br>

### This project will later utilize Apache Maven in order to compile and package into an external JAR that includes dependencies required to implement charts, graphs, and other components.
